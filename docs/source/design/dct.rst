How to Write Design Code
========================

In an abstract sense, a Python function takes in input values and returns output values. Similarly, we can apply this definition to a Python class, which takes in input values and instead returns a Python object that represents the class.

This guide will show you how to write code to design a physical object, like an AguaClara water treatment plant component. Using a Python class, this design code will be able to take in desired parameters of the physical object, like flow rate, and return a Python object that contains all of the necessary physical values to build that object in real life.

This guide assumes knowledge of basic Python syntax. For a refresher, see the `AguaClara Writing Python Code guide <https://aguaclara.github.io/aguaclara_tutorial/python-and-hydrogen/writing-python-code.html>`_.
