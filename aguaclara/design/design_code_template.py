# How to Import
# These are the imports from other files or python packages that you would want 
# to use in the file.

from aguaclara.core.units import unit_registry as u #Gives python units
from aguaclara.design.component import Component 	#Allows for the objects to

# How to name things
# To name a variable or a function, for example minimum area of a pipe, you 
# shorten the main words using (min a of a pipe), and make it in a directory 
# format with underscores (pipe_a_min). 

# How to make a subcomponent
# Just make a normal component, and in your main component make sure you 
# propogate the configs

# use those functions and abilities. The class Monroe is an example of a

# component.

    component class, what it generally calculates, and what its subcomponents
    are.)

    (The Attributes section describes the class variables that are defined
    in the class, but outside of __init__. Be sure to document the variable
    name, its type, and a plain language description of what it stores.)

		# If your component has a subcomponent (self.pc for our case, as it's default

	# you can.

	# Use spaces around operators, minimal parentheses, keep lines under 80 
	# characters (use \ if necessary),as well as refrain from having the whole
