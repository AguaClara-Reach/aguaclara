# Naming convention for functions, variables, etc:
# The naming convention is like a tree. To write the variable version for the 
# minimum area of a pipe in the LFOM class, you start with the most genera, 
# branch, pipe, then a branch (or property) of the pipe, area, then a branch 
# of area, minimum. So, the var name would be pipe_area_minimum. This is overly 
# long however so we have the design variable naming conventions google sheet, 
# to learn how to abbreviate each word. Using the google sheet, the variable 
# name for the minimum area of a pipe is pipe_a_min. Other things to remember, 
# is everything is lowercase and underscores other than classes (capitalize 
# first letter, no spaces) and class variables(all caps, underscores)
