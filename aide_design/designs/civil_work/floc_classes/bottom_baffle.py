class BottomBaffle:
    """This is a bottom baffle class. It includes information of length,
    thickness, and width of the baffles on the bottom of the flocculator. 
    Baffles are obstructions in the channel of a flocculator to force the 
    flow to switch directions by 180Â°. Baffles in AguaClara plants are 
    plastic sheets, and all of the baffles in one flocculator channel are 
    connected to form a baffle module.
